**🫀 Cardiac Outcome Analysis Dashboard**

**📚 Project Overview**

This project showcases an interactive dashboard for analyzing clinical data related to cardiac outcomes. Using real patient-level data, the dashboard enables detailed exploration of key cardiac biomarkers, patient demographics, and outcome trends, empowering clinicians and researchers to derive actionable insights for risk assessment and patient care improvements.

**🔬 Objectives**

Visualize cardiac biomarker trends (Troponin, CK-MB, Blood Sugar, Heart Rate) across different age groups and outcomes.

Segment patient outcomes (positive/negative) and demographic attributes (age, gender).

Support early detection and better management of cardiac events.

.

**🏥 Key KPIs**
**Total Patients:** 1,319

**Average Troponin Level:** 0.36

**Average CK-MB Level:** 15.27

**Average Blood Sugar:** 146.63

**Average Heart Rate:** 78.34

**🖥️ Dashboard Features**
**Patient Segmentation:** Filter results by outcome, age group, and gender.

**Biomarker Visualization:**

Average CK-MB and Troponin by age.

Blood Sugar and Heart Rate summary statistics.

**Outcome Analysis:** Breakdown of positive (61.41%) vs. negative (38.59%) cardiac results.

**Interactive Charts:** Explore distributions, trends, and relationships between age and biomarkers.

**Data Table:** View underlying data for transparency and reproducibility.

**🛠️ Technologies Used**

**Data Format:** csv

**Data Visualization:** Power Bi

**💡 Insights**
Positive outcomes (indicative of cardiac events) are observed in 61% of patients.

Troponin and CK-MB levels vary significantly with age, highlighting key risk profiles.

The dashboard allows for rapid clinical stratification based on patient features.

**🎯 Value Proposition**
This project demonstrates proficiency in real-world healthcare data analysis, dashboard-building, and translating raw clinical results into meaningful visual insights for healthcare stakeholders.
