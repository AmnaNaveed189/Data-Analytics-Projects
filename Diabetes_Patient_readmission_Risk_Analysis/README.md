🔬 **Project Name: Diabetes Patient Readmission Risk Analysis Dashboard**

🎯 **Project Objectives:**
• To identify key factors driving hospital readmissions for diabetes patients.
• To create an interactive, executive-level dashboard for monitoring KPIs.
• To provide actionable insights that could help reduce future readmission rates and improve patient care.

🛠 **Tech Stack Used:**
• 𝐒𝐐𝐋: For data extraction, aggregation, and complex conditional analysis.
• 𝐏𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐁𝐈: For building an interactive and visually intuitive dashboard.
• 𝐃𝐀𝐗: For creating calculated measures and key performance indicators (KPIs).

📖 **What I Learned & Demonstrated:**
• 𝐒𝐐𝐋 𝐌𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐲: Wrote complex queries using CTEs, conditional aggregation (CASE WHEN), and window functions to segment and analyze patient data by diagnosis, age, medication changes, and prior visits.
• 𝐏𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐁𝐈 𝐃𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧: Transformed SQL result sets into a cohesive narrative using treemaps, clustered bar charts, KPIs, and matrix visuals.
• 𝐃𝐀𝐗 𝐏𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫: Created dynamic measures to calculate readmission rates and targets, making the dashboard fully interactive.
• 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐢𝐭𝐲: Built slicers for medical specialty and age, allowing users to drill down from a high-level KPI to the specific underlying factors in seconds.

📊 **Key Results & Insights:**
The data revealed a critical overall readmission rate of 47.02%. The dashboard allows us to instantly see that:
• Patients aged 70+ are at the highest risk.
• Primary diagnoses of Diabetes and Respiratory issues have alarmingly high readmission rates (>49%).
• A history of high prior inpatient visits is a major red flag for future readmission.
• The interaction between diabetes medication and medication changes is a significant predictor of outcomes
