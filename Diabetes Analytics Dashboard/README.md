**🩺 Diabetes Patient Analysis Dashboard**

**📌 Project Overview**

This interactive dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of diabetes-related patient data, enabling researchers, clinicians, and stakeholders to visualize key health metrics and risk profiles. The dashboard highlights the prevalence of diabetes, critical biomarkers, and the distribution of risk factors within the patient cohort.

**🎯 Objectives**

Assess the prevalence and key risk factors for diabetes in a large patient sample.

Visualize correlations and trends in biomarkers such as BMI, glucose, insulin, and blood pressure.

Identify high-risk demographic segments for targeted interventions.

**🔑 Key Metrics**

**Total Patients:** 2,768

**Diabetes Prevalence:** 34.39%

**Average Diabetes Pedigree Function (DPF):** 0.47

**High-Risk Patients Identified:** 109

**Average Age (Diabetic Patients):** 36.99

**📊 Dashboard Features**

**Pregnancy Distribution by Age:** Scatter plot visualization to explore relationship patterns.

**SkinThickness and BMI:** Correlation analysis highlighted by scatter plot and regression trend line.

**Blood Pressure Distribution:** Histogram showing normal versus hypertensive ranges.

**🛠️ Technologies Used**

**Data Format:** csv

**Data Visualization:** Power Bi


**💡 Insights**

Over one-third of patients in this cohort have diabetes, with a mean age just under 37.

Glucose levels and BMI emerge as strong indicators for diabetes risk.

Visualizations allow healthcare teams to quickly spot at-risk individuals for early interventions.

**🚀 Value Proposition**

This project demonstrates the end-to-end analytical lifecycle, from data wrangling to impactful insight-delivery, using real health data to support clinical decision-making and research.

**Age vs. Insulin:** Understand insulin levels across age brackets to spot outliers and trends.

**Glucose Trends by Age:** Line graph showing how glucose readings shift as patients age.

**Glucose vs. BMI:** Scatter plot illustrating the relationship and thresholds for diabetes (glucose ≥126 mg/dL) and obesity (BMI ≥30).
